This project illustrates the cash flow of a fixed-rate mortgage with level monthly payments and an additional servicing fee.

The mortgage includes monthly interest payments and scheduled principal repayments.

The accompanying graph provides a visual representation of the declining mortgage balance over time, showing how the interest and principal components of each payment change throughout the loan term.

This tool can help visualize loan amortization schedules, understand how mortgages are repaid, and analyze the impact of servicing fees on total payments.
